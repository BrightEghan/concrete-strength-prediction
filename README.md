# Concrete Strength Prediction

This project uses machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its ingredients like cement, water, coarse and fine aggregates, and admixtures. Dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

## Dataset
- [UCI Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/concrete+compressive+strength)
